# Employee-Attrition

Hello everyone,
I make a prediction model to predict Employee Attrition in Company XYZ.
I got this datasets from Kaggle, here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study
There are 5 datasets in my final project. I did a Data Cleaning and Preparation, Data Analysis and Visualization, Model Building, and Evaluation to measure the effectiveness of attrition prediction.
In this prediction model, I used Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as the model to predict employee attrition. And for the evaluation, I used the Recall Metric.
This research will help companies to find out and prevent employee attrition in their company. Predicting employee attrition enables organizations to proactively retain talent, reduce turnover costs, maintain productivity, and address underlying issues such as poor management or lack of advancement opportunities.

Overall Steps:

- Import the libraries
- Import all the Dataset
- Data Preparation
  - Handling missing value and duplicated data
  - Outliers analysis
  - Removing outliers
  - Encoding the categorical data
- Modelling
  - Split data into Xtrain, ytrain, Xtest, ytest
  - Scaling the data using standard scaler
  - Feature selection using Boruta Shap
  - Modelling Classification ML algorithms:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - Tuning the Decision Tree model
- Evaluation using Recall Metric: because the data is IMBALANCE
  -  Evaluating the ML algorithms:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - Tuning the Decision Tree model


Thank You in Advance!
